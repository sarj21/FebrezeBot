VT Hacks III Project

VT Hacks is a 36 hour hackathon where teams compete to create hardware and software projects. At the end of the competetion the top 8 teams present


Our team made it to the top 8 but didnt make the top 3. Its ok though, our robot was very silly. There were some amazing projects!

One of our original design specs was to take a Myo Arm Band to control the robots motion. A lot of the files used are in the repository, however there is a huge lack of support for linux or arduino in the myo sdk so we had to drop that support since we used arduino and bluetooth to control our robot.
